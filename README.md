Objective: To create a traffic light management system using Java programming language. The system should be able to control the timing and switching of traffic lights at an intersection, simulating the real-life traffic control system. The system should include the following features:

->Multiple traffic lights at the intersection, each with its own color (red, yellow, or green) and time limit.
->A traffic controller that manages the timing and switching of the traffic lights.
->A predefined schedule for switching the traffic lights, based on the traffic flow.
->A timer that keeps track of how long each traffic light has been on and switches the lights according to the predefined schedule.
->A simulation of the traffic flow, where cars move in different directions based on the status of the traffic lights.

The objective of this project is to create a functional simulation of a traffic management system using Java, which can be used to study and optimize the traffic flow at an intersection.
